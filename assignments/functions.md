1. Define two methods to print the maximum and the minimum number respectively among three numbers entered by user.

2. Define a program to find out whether a given number is even or odd.

3. A person is elligible to vote if his/her age is greater than or equal to 18. Define a method to find out if he/she is elligible to vote.

4. Write a program to print the sum of two numbers entered by user by defining your own method.

5. Define a method that returns the product of two numbers entered by user.

6. Write a program to print the circumference and area of a circle of radius entered by user by defining your own method.

7. Define a method to find out if number is prime or not.

8. Write a program which will ask the user to enter his/her marks (out of 100). Define a method that will display grades according to the marks entered as below:
Marks        Grade
91-100         AA
81-90          AB
71-80          BB
61-70          BC
51-60          CD
41-50          DD
<=40          Fail

9. Write a program to print the factorial of a number by defining a method named 'Factorial'.
Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1*2*3*....*(n-1)*n. E.g.-
4! = 1*2*3*4 = 24
3! = 3*2*1 = 6
2! = 2*1 = 2
Also,
1! = 1
0! = 1

10. Write a function to find if a number if palindrome or not. Take number as parameter.

11. Convert the programs in [flow of program](flow-of-program.md), [conditionals & loops](conditionals-loops.md), [first java](first-java.md) assignemts into functions.
